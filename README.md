## LDTS_11_6 - Super Mario Bros

In the context of the project,we developed a game based on Super Mario Bros.
This is a 2D game where the player goes along the map and wins when reaches the flag.
Throughout the map there are a lot of obstacles such as monsters, blocks and some pits.
Furthermore, there are Mystery Blocks which the player can reveal to collect coins and mushrooms in order to win points.
